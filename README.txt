Simple application that uses IQAir's AirVisual API and Google Play Service's location API with phone GPS capabilities to determine air quality at the user's current location with Firebase for recordkeeping. (API key and Firebase json removed for obvious reasons.)

Delivers the US-based metric for air quality - a scale from 0-500 where:  
0-50 is Good  
51-100 is Moderate  
101-150 is Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups  
151-200 is Unhealthy  
201-300 is Very Unhealthy  
301-500 is Hazardous
